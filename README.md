# rubiksCube
Project for CS2999 at Oakland University, alongside Parker Goby, Jay Frankina, Angelo Espinosa, Tej Singh, and Thomas Bozek. The goal of this project was to create a website application with a Rubik's cube that the user can interact with and attempt to solve, with an automatic solution button.
