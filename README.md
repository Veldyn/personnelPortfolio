# rubiksCube
Project for CSI2999 at Oakland University, alongside Parker Goby, Jay Frankina, Angelo Espinosa, Tej Singh, and Thomas Bozek. The goal of this project was to create a website application with a Rubik's cube that the user can interact with and attempt to solve, with an automatic solution button.

This Project will make use of Java to code the Rubik's Cube itself, and a web-based language to implement this into a web page.
